Q8) A person takes a loan of 20,000 partly from a bank at 8% per annum and remaining from another bank at 10% per annum. Total interest on this he pays as 1950 per annum. Then what is the amount he took from the first bank?
Soln: Let's assume if the person takes a loan of x from first bank and y from second bank. Hence according to given information:
Interest at 8%= 8% of 20000=1600
Interest at 10%= 10% of 20000=2000
Total interest=1950
The ratio of money taken=
(2000-1950) : (1950-1600)
=50: 350
=1:7
Money taken from first bank = 20,000 x (1/8) = 2500

Soln: one day work done by A=1/20
work done by A in 2 days=1/10
work done by A,B,C on 3rd day=1/20+1/30+1/60=1/10
total work done in 3 days= 1/10+1/10= 1/5
1/5th of the work will be completed at the end of 3 days
the remaining work =1-1/5=4/5
4/5 of work will be completed 1/5*5/4*3= 12 days
total work wiil be done in  3+12 =15 days

Q7) 4 men can check exam papers in 8 days working 5 hours regularly. What is the total hours when 2 men will check the double of the papers in 20 days?
Soln: total work done=4*8*5=160units
now work=2*160=320units
now,2 men work for 20days,let x be the hours.
therefore, 2*20*x=320
x=8 hours

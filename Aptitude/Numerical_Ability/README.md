Q6) The average temperature for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday is 48. The average temperature for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday is 46. If the temperature of Monday is 42 find the temperature on Friday. 
Soln: Total Temp of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday is 48X4 = 192 or 42 + Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday = 192  or  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday = 192-42 =>  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday = 150. 
Total Temp of  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday = 46X4 = 184 or 150 + Friday = 184 => Friday = 34. 

Q7) 3 boxes have some average weight. A box weighing 89kg is replaced by another box. Now the average weight increases by 5. What is the weight of the new box? 
Soln: If weight of each box before was x. Then average weight was 3x. When weight of box increases by 5 on average then it is (x+5)X3. So, the weight of the new box is 89+15 = 103kgs. 

Q8) Had Ajay scored 18 more runs in 3rd innings and 4 more runs in 7th innings his average would have been 66 runs. But he has 64 runs as average. How many innings did he play?

Q11) The average of 1st 3 of 4 numbers is 16 and of the last 3 are 15. If the sum of the first and the last number is 13. What is the last numbers? 
Soln: A+B+C = 16x3 = 48.......(i)
B+C+D = 15x3 = 45......(ii)
(i)-(ii)=> A-D = 3 
A+D  = 13 
.'. D = 5
